					<p><b>From the Scrum Guide</b></p>
					<q>Scrum is a framwork for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.</q>

					<h3>Cynefin Model</h3>
					<img src="./content/images/Cynefin_as_of_1st_June_2014.png"
						alt="cynefin model: simple, complicated, complex, chaos" />
					<aside class="notes">
						This is the cynefin model to aid decision-making.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Obvious (or simple): This is obvious to the person in that domain. If the problem is obvious, You've got
								to get a sense of what the problem is-
								categorize the problem, and respond. This means that there are rules in place/best practices, the
								problem is very clear and the situation is stable.
								There's likely only one right answer (known knowns).
							</li>
							<li>
								Complicated: This requires analysis. So first, you get a sense of what the problem is, analyze the
								problem, and respond.
								There's probably a range of right answers (known unknowns)
							</li>
							<li>
								Complex: This can't be analyzed, and requires some kind of probing (experimenting), then sensing- which
								is analyzing the data, and then responding. (unknown unknowns)
							</li>
							<li>
								Chaos is just bad. (Run) This is when action is required up front to establish some order, then sensing,
								and then responding. (Stop the bleeding)
							</li>
							Scrum lives between the Complicated domain and the complex one, to be able to take the complex problems,
							break them down into complicated ones.
							Where each sprint is kind of an experiment of sorts.

					<h3>Characteristics of Scrum</h3>

						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Scrum is lightweight, simple to understand, but difficult to master. Each component (i.e. roles and
						ceremonies) serves a purpose, and specifc responsibilities.
						There are 3 pillars to Scrum:
						<p>*click* Transparency: Aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
							These aspects should be defined by a common standard so everyone shares a common understanding of what is
							being seen.
							This takes place in a non-judgemental environment. It's everyone's problem, therefore everyone's
							responsible
							for the solution.</p>
						<p>*click* Inspection: Members should be frequently inspecting the scrum artifacts and progress toward a
							sprint
							goal.
							But shouldn't be so
							frequent that it's an impediment.</p>
						<p>*click* Adaptation:
							If during the inspection process, we start to see deviations, we need to address the issue, and course
							correct.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>These come from the manifesto. And are built on that agile is about people</p>
						<p>Individuals and Interactions over Process and Tools.
							Agile is about people. Don't get caught up in "Don't do the smart thing because it's not in our process"
							or "Let's do the dumb
							thing because it's our process"</p>
						<p>Working software over comprehensive documentation. no need to over document code, or proceedures, getting
							the software to work and be consumable is the priority</p>
						<p> Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation. This allows us to give what the customers need- not
							necessarily what they want.</p>
						<p>Responding to change over following a plan. We should be responsive and flexible to circumstances, and
							not dig our heals into any specific plan</p>
						<p>This does not mean just throw away the left. But enough of what's on the right *click*, to make the left
							*click* awesome. </p>

					<h3>Important parts of Scrum</h3>
					<p><b>Retrospective</b> is the most important part of Scrum. <b>Backlog refinement</b> is the second most
						important.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Retrospective is the most important part of Scrum. This is the part that takes inspection to adaptation. You
						have to change 1, and only 1 thing to improve. These can be impactful, so avoiding blaming is important. In
						fact,
						one of the things that Bob tried is banning the word "because" or "because of" in his retros.
						Then, backlog refinement is the second most important thing. Again, this an area that takes inspection to
						adaptation. We don't want to go down one path and
						develop something wasteful/pointless. We have to be able to adapt our product backlog too.

					<h3>Scrum Team</h3>

						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>*click* The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product backlog. This
								includes making
								it clear, and visible, and making sure that the backlog is in priority order.
							</li>
							<li>
								*click* The Development team is responsible for delivering a releasable increment of done at the end of
								each
								sprint. They are self organizing, and cross functional. There's no sub teams nor titles.
							</li>
							<li>
								*click* The Scrum Master helps promote scrum. They are a servant-leader for the Scrum Team and maximizes
								the
								value produced by the team. They are there to serve the team, and aspire to lead them to success. They

							<span class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="3">: Time-box to forecast the the next
								24-hours

						<li class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="4">Sprint Review
							<span class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="4">: Review the last Increment and adapt

						<li class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="5,6">Scrum Retrospective
							<span class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="5">: Vent session</span>
							<span class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="6">: Inspection of the last sprint
								and create plan for improvements</span>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>*click* The sprint is a time frame of when a product Increment is created. This product increment is a
							useable, and
							possibly releasable piece of functionality. The sprint contains the planning, daily scrums, the
							development
							work, the sprint review, and the retro. </p>
						<p> *click* The Sprint Planning answers the questions of what can be delivered
							in the Increment rsulting from the upcoming Sprint? And how will the work needed to deliver the Increment
							be
							acheived </p>
						<p> *click* The Daily Scrum is a short 15 minute daily meeting in the DEV team to plan work for the next 24
							hours. This
							is to optimize the performance. This is a big proponent for the "Adaptation" pillar of the Empirical
							process.</p>
						<p> *click* The Sprint Review is to Review the last increment developed during that sprint. This gives a
							chance to
							adapt the product backlog if necessary. This meeting is not a status meeting. This is a presentation to
							elicit
							feedback- and Bob says that it should be a positive feedback, not a time to be critical or add a wish
							list.</p>
						<p> *click* The Retro is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for
							improvements. This
							inspection is in regards to people, relationships, process, and tools. Bob mentioned you should limit to 1
							action item.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Reasons Sprint Teams fail</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Routinely carrying over work from one sprint to the next</li>
						<li>They can't work quality into a Sprint</li>
						<li>Lousy Product Backlog</li>

					<h3>50% of work can be a waste</h3>
					<canvas class="stretch" data-chart="pie">
						,"Bad Stuff", "Good Stuff", "Great Stuff"
						My first dataset, 50, 30, 20
					</canvas>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>In our class, it was said that on average, the last (right) half of the product backlog, is filled with
							work
							isn't
							used, or doesn't affect the users. Or in some fashion, this last (right) half is a waste of time.</p>
						<p> That might not be the case for us, but does give an area to inspect for waste. That doesn't
							mean the "Bad stuff" isn't stuff we shouldn't implement, it's just saying that they might be time
							wasters, or not as profitable as the "Great/Good" stuff.</p>
						<p> (Show drawing) So let's say we have project a, and project b, both with dollar values upon completing
							the product backlog.
							If we split each product in half, Project B's first "Great and good " stuff might be worth more than
							project a's bad stuff. (Or "not good
							enough stuff"). So it's more beneficial to have Each projects' first half done and released before their
							second halves.

					<h3>Tuckman Model</h3>
					<img src="content/images/TuckmanGraph2.jfif" height="400"
						alt="tuckman model of forming, storming, norming, performing" />
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>There was an interesting model shown called the Tuckman model.
							These are the phases a team would go through. First is the Forming stage. This is where it's just
							introductory.</p>
						<p>The next is storming where they are figuring each other's boundaries, and maybe being slightly combative,
							but because they are pushing each other, and being
							a little adventurous with presenting their thoughts, they are more productive.
							Then after sometime they start to mesh together and come to solutions a bit faster. That's the norming
							phase.</p>
						<p>After they start to build their solution-creating skills together, they start to speak the same language
							and
							work seemlessly. This the performing team. This is estimated to be 50% more productivite than the initial
							forming team.</p>
						<p>If we are every quarter or every other sprint shuffling around we might not be through that stroming
							phase
							long enough
							to learn how to be productive for long. Making us lose out on getting stuff done faster, and potential
							money.</p>

					<h3>Transparency</h3>
					<p>Project estimates</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="1">
							Fixed Scope = Flexible time
						</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="2">
							Flexible Scope = Fixed time
						</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="3">
							Fixed Scope + Fixed Time = Pad the release date by A LOT.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						When it comes to estimating projects, this is a scrum team effort. And there are some constraints to
						understand.
						<p>*click* If the scope is fixed, then the release date must be flexible.</p>
						<p>*click* If the release date is fixed, then the scope must be flexible.</p>
						<p>*click* If the scope and release date must be fixed, then that release date must be padded by a lot.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Say no</h3>
					<p>Be able to say "No, <em><u>why</u></em> <em><u>offer alternatives/solutions</u></em>"</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						All members of the scrum team need to have the ability to say no. But just saying no isn't very well
						received / might not make a difference.
						So saying no in this no, why, alternatives structure actually can be very productive.

					<h3>Empowerment Bill of Rights</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Build the person up</li>
						<li>Clearly frame the Empowerment</li>
						<li>Give contraints</li>
						<li>Give advice</li>
						<li>Test it</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is something we should implement to our development team. Give them the path to be successful by giving
						the courage and tools to be successful. And set up a route to fail, I mean, learn fast.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Speed round</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>"<del>Fail</del>" => "Learn"</li>
						<li>
							Eliminate waste
						</li>
						<li>
							These roles are full time roles
						</li>
						<li>
							Should have a $1000/yr budget for team building
						</li>
						<li>Lack of cross team/project communication can lead to double work/effort. Transparency is key</li>
						<li>Multitasking is <span class="fragment highlight-red">HORRIBLE</span></li>

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Changing fail to learn is just a bit more of a positive twist to allowing us to try things, and not be
								fearful of making a wrong decision.
							</li>
							<li>
								I thought having a priority of eliminating waste kind of shifts the mind during the scrum ceremonies.
								Maybe think about how to eliminate waste in regards to EOS structure.
							</li>
							<li>The scrum guide was written with having these scrum team members being a full-time position. Which I
								think we are actually kind of close. Thoughts on trying to push for full time dedicated roles?
							</li>
							<li>
								Bob suggested that there should be about 1000 annual budget for team building on a given scrum team.
								This is for activities in scrum events, learning material, team building, team lunches, etc. This can increase moral
								and team dynamics in order to move along the tuckman model faster.
							</li>
							<li>
								Multitasking is horrible. The more you take on, the less productive you are. I think for the most part,
								we keep one task in progress as much as possible. But sometimes we have multiple projects being worked on for
								one team, and that can be difficult to remain focused and productive with.

					<h3>Things to consider</h3>
					<ul>
							<li>
								Try to have at least 1 static scrum team.
							</li>
						<li>
							What about management/executives doing Scrum?
						</li>
						<li>
							Getting a fulltime "Product Owner" role involved.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>
								We could try to do at least 1 team that stays together running under scrum. That might not be totally productive.
							</li>
							<li>
								So what about management/executives doing scrum. If we had more training across the organization, there might be a clearer path to running scrum.
							</li>
							<li>
								What about getting a fulltime Product Owner from the IT side involved. This would be someone who owns the product backlogs.
