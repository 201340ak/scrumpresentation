					<p><b>From the Scrum Guide</b></p>
					<q>Scrum is a framwork for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.</q>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is quoted from the Scrum Guide. And this is very true. This is about how to develop, deliver and
						maintain products.

					<h3>Cynefin Model</h3>
					<img src="./content/images/Cynefin_as_of_1st_June_2014.png"
						alt="cynefin model: simple, complicated, complex, chaos" />
					<aside class="notes">
						This is the cynefin model to aid decision-making.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Obvious (or simple): This is obvious to the person in that domain. If the problem is obvious, You've got
								to get a sense of what the problem is-
								categorize the problem, and respond. This means that there are rules in place/best practices, the
								problem is very clear and the situation is stable.
								There's likely only one right answer (known knowns).
							</li>
							<li>
								Complicated: This requires analysis. So first, you get a sense of what the problem is, analyze the
								problem, and respond.
								There's probably a range of right answers (known unknowns)
							</li>
							<li>
								Complex: This can't be analyzed, and requires some kind of probing (experimenting), then sensing- which
								is analyzing the data, and then responding. (unknown unknowns)
							</li>
							<li>
								Chaos is just bad. (Run) This is when action is required up front to establish some order, then sensing,
								and then responding. (Stop the bleeding)
							</li>

							Scrum lives between the Complicated domain and the complex one, to be able to take the complex problems,
							break them down into complicated ones.
							Where each sprint is kind of an experiment of sorts.

					<h3>Characteristics of Scrum</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Lightweight, simple to understand, difficult to master</li>
						<li>Each component serve a specific purpose</li>
						<li>Empirical process:
							<span class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="1">
								Transparency,
							</span>
							<span class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="2">
								Inspection,
							</span>
							<span class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="3">
								Adaptation
							</span>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Each component serves a purpose, and specifc responsibilities.
						There are 3 pillars to Scrum:
						<p>Transparency: aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
							These aspects should be defined by a common standard so everyone shares a common understanding of what is
							being seen.
							This takes place in a non-judgemental environment. It's everyone's problem, therefore everyone's
							responsible
							for the solution.</p>
						<p>Inspection: Members should be frequently inspecting the scrum artifacts and progress toward a sprint
							goal.
							But shouldn't be so
							frequent that it's an impediment.</p>
						<p>Adaptation:
							If during the inspection process, we start to see deviations, we need to address the issue, and course
							correct.</p>

						Agile is about people.
						Don't get caught up in "Don't do the smart thing because it's not in our process" or "Let's do the dumb
						thing because it's our process"
						Give what the customers need- not necessarily what they want.
						This does not mean just throw away the left. But enough of what's on the right, to make the left awesome.

					<h3>Important parts of Scrum</h3>
					<p><b>Retrospective</b> is the most important part of Scrum. Backlog refinement is the second most important.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Retrospective is the most important part of Scrum. This is the part that takes inspection to adaptation. You
						have to change 1, and only 1 thing to improve.
						Then, backlog refinement is the second most important thing. Again, this an area that takes inspection to
						adaptation. We don't want to go down one path and
						develop something wasteful/pointless. We have to be able to adapt our product backlog too.

					<h3>Scrum Team</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="1">Product Owner

								backlog</span>

								deliverable)</span>
						</li>
						<li class="fragment highlight-current-red" data-fragment-index="3">Scrum Master
							<span class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="3">: Responsible for promoting and supporting
								Scrum. Servant-leader</span>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product backlog. This includes making it
						clear, and visible, and making sure that
						the backlog is in priority order.
						The Development team is responsible for delivering a releasable increment of done at the end of each sprint.
						They are self organizing, and cross functional.
						There's no sub teams nor titles.
						The Scrum Master helps promote scrum. They are a servant-leader for the Scrum Team and maximizes the value
						produced by the team.
						They are there to serve the team, and aspire to lead them to success. They are often the facilitator between
						business needs, and development needs.

						<li class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="5,6">Scrum Retrospective
							<span class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="5">: Vent session</span>
							<span class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="6">: Inspection of the last sprint
								and create plan for improvements</span>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						The sprint is a time frame of when a product Increment is created. This product increment is a useable, and
						possibly releasable piece of functionality. The sprint contains the planning, daily scrums, the development
						work, the sprint review, and the retro.
						The Sprint Planning answers the questions of what can be delivered
						in the Increment rsulting from the upcoming Sprint? And how will the work needed to deliver the Increment be
						acheived
						The Daily Scrum is a short 15 minute daily meeting in the DEV team to plan work for the next 24 hours. This
						is
						to optimize the performance. This is a big proponent for the "Adaptation" pillar of the Empirical process.
						The Sprint Review is to Demonstate the last increment developed during that sprint. This gives a chance to
						adapt
						the product backlog if necessary. This meeting is not a status meeting. This is a presentation to elicit
						feedback-
						and Bob says that it should be a positive feedback, not a time to be critical or add a wish list.
						The Retro is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements. This
						inspection
						is in regards to people, relationships, process, and tools. Bob mentioned you should limit to 1 action item.

					<h3>Reasons Sprint Teams fail</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Routinely carrying over work from one sprint to the next</li>
						<li>They can't work quality into a Sprint</li>
						<li>Lousy Product Backlog</li>

					<h3>50% of work can be a waste</h3>
					<canvas class="stretch" data-chart="pie">
						,"Great Stuff", "Good Stuff", "Bad Stuff"
						My first dataset, 20, 30, 50
					</canvas>
					<aside class="notes">
						In our class, it was said that on average, the last half of the product backlog, is filled with work isn't
						used, or doesn't affect the users.
						Or in some fashion, this last half is a waste of time. That might not be the case for us, but does give an
						area to inspect for waste. That doesn't mean the "Bad stuff" isn't stuff we shouldn't implement, it's just
						saying
						that they might be time wasters, or not as profitable as the "Great/Good" stuff.
						So let's say we have project a, and project b, both with dollar values upon completing the product backlog.
						If we split each product in half,
						Project B's first "Great and good " stuff might be worth more than project a's bad stuff. (Or "not good
						enough stuff"). So it's more beneficial to have
						Each projects' first half done and released before their second halves.
						Clear as mud? (Maybe draw up diagram we saw in class)

					<h3>Tuckman Model</h3>
					<img src="content/images/TuckmanGraph2.jfif" height="400"
						alt="tuckman model of forming, storming, norming, performing" />
					<aside class="notes">
						There was an interesting model shown called the Tuckman model.
						These are the phases a team would go through. First is the Forming stage. This is where it's just
						introductory.
						The next is storming where they are figuring each other's boundaries, and maybe being slightly combative,
						but because they are pushing each other, and being
						a little adventurous with presenting their thoughts, they are more productive.
						Then after sometime they start to mesh together and come to solutions a bit faster. That's the norming
						phase.
						After they start to build their solution-creating skills together, they start to speak the same language and
						work seemlessly. This the performing team. This is estimated to be 50% more productivite than the initial
						forming team.
						If we are every quarter or every other sprint shuffling around we might not be through that stroming phase
						long enough
						to learn how to be productive for long. Making us lose out on getting stuff done faster, and potential
						money.

						<li>Test it</li>

					<h3>Speed round</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>"<del>Fail</del>" => "Learn"</li>
						<li>
							Eliminate waste
						</li>
						<li>
							These roles are full time roles
						</li>
						<li>
							Product owner should have been Backlog owner
						</li>
						<li>
							Should have a $1000/yr budget for team building
						</li>
						<li>Multitasking is <span class="fragment highlight-red">HORRIBLE</span></li>

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Changing fail to learn is just a bit more of a positive twist to allowing us to try things, and not be
						fearful of making a wrong decision.
						I thought having a priority of eliminating waste kind of shifts the mind during the scrum ceremonies.
						The scrum guide was written with having these scrum team members being a full-time position. Which I think
						we are actually kind of close. Just no Product owners.
						Product Owner should have been Backlog Owner, but they didn't want the abbreviation "BO" -- not that "PO" is
						any better. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
						Bob suggested that there should be about 1000 annual budget for team building on a given scrum team. This is
						for activities in scrum events, learning material, team building, team lunches, etc.
						Retro is the most important part in a sprint. It takes that inspection into real tangible adaptation. You
						have to change at least 1 thing in a given sprint, and always be adapting and improving as a team

					<h3>Things to consider</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							What about management doing Scrum?
						</li>
						<li>
							Or try to have 1 static scrum team. (Rotate members for group management)
						</li>
						<li>
							Getting a fulltime "Product Owner" role involved.
